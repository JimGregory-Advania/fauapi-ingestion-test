    -  `description` - This value must not exceed 40 characters.
    -  `backendType` - There are three available options - `http` (rest) ,`soap`, and `graphql`. If a different option is given, the specification will fail on validation.
    -  `majorVersion` - This value must not exceed the 50 character limit, e.g. 'v1.0'.
    -  `environments` - They are not required for this scenario, therefore the object is left empty.

3. **Auto Publish Linked API** \

    All the properties from section 1 and 2 are required here as well.

   - `releases` - At least one release is required. `IsCurrent` flag must be set to `true`. Otherwise the specification will not validate. The tag must
